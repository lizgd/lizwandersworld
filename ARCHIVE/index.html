                An explorer at heart but with a mind set in the far future, my goal is to be exposed to and work on ideas that can enable eudaemonia (human flourishing) for generations to come. I am fascinated by ideas and technologies that can change how we live with technology and interact with our environment - such as AR/VR, eVTOLs, generative design, brain computer interfaces, biology in architecture, and human augmentation through our devices. A string that runs through what I do is the idea of enhancing our sense of curiosity and exploration of the world around us through our devices.

                I just moved to SF to start full time at Humane and explore the West Coast. Two years ago I was on a gap year, interning at Apple and exposing myself to a myriad of ideas about the future. Now I am at Humane, still exposing myself to a myriad of ideas about the future. My goal is to follow my curiosity, create a mental toolbox of how things work, try not to fall into any specific way of thinking about the world, and help design the technologies that will set the stage for human-computer interaction for decades to come.

My side project in school was Bello, an experiment in social tools, which I may continue one day if there is time because I want to make small world moments a beautiful regular occurrence. Overall, pursuing my curiosities and enjoying the ride along the way.</p>

                    <p>Helping create the future of computing @ Humane. Prototyped some cool things I can't talk about @ Apple Technology (now Vision) Development Group. Created a non-intrusive BCI @ Astri in Hong Kong. Organized a 100+ person 25+ speaker conference about the ethical implications of emerging technologies @ Envision. Supported women in STEM @ SWE, PWICS, NCWIT. Led some entrepreneurship groups in college. Made a few projects.</p>
